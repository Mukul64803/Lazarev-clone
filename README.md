# Lazarev Clone

Welcome to my project! This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my skills in web development. I have integrated GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and CSS animations to create engaging animations that enhance the user experience. For smooth scrolling effects, I have utilized Locomotive Scroll, providing a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my project as much as I enjoyed creating it!
